# VariableDescriptionBase
Creates a VariableDescription.xlsx file to the same folder as input geospatial data. Lists all the variables in a dataset for the data handler to explain as part of the necessary data documentation. Each map layer is written as a separate Excel sheet.

V2 version with added variable impact assesment via null precentage and list of unique variables. Use to possibly drop unnecessary/uninformative variables.
